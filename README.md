Map Tour
=======================

Powerful little map-based tour prototype for storytelling.  Single-page-app that transitions through a series of map views.

Each view manages itself according to the React component lifecycle: bootstrapping itself on mount, setting event timers, adding map sources and layers, running animations, etc. and then cleaning up after itself on unmount, ready for the next view.  

Each view has one associated React Component and Route and takes advantage of Browser History.  Includes keyboard controls for navigation - space, left, right.

Based on [react-mapbox-gl-seed](https://github.com/twelch/react-mapbox-gl-seed).  Refactored to use one shared map across views instead of one map per view.

Based on the [react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit)

README
======

Requirements
------------

Node `^4.0.0`

Getting Started
---------------

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/twelch/reactmap-tour.git
$ cd reactmap-tour
$ npm install
```

Edit config/client.js and enter your public mapbox access token.

Usage
-----

#### `npm run dev` also `npm start`
Runs the webpack build system just like in `compile` but enables HMR. The webpack dev server can be found at `localhost:3000`.

#### `npm run dev:nw`
Same as `npm run dev` but opens the debug tools in a new window.

**Note:** you'll need to allow popups in Chrome, or you'll see an error: [issue 110](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit/issues/110)

#### `npm run dev:no-debug`
Same as `npm run dev` but disables devtools.

#### `npm run compile`
Runs the Webpack build system with your current NODE_ENV and compiles the application to disk (`~/dist`). Production builds will fail on eslint errors (but not on warnings).

#### `npm run test`
Runs unit tests with Karma.

#### `npm run test:dev`
Same as `npm run test`, but will watch for changes and re-run tests.

#### `npm run deploy`
Helper script to run tests and then, on success, compile your application.

### Configuration

Basic project configuration can be found in `~/config/index.js`. Here you'll be able to redefine your src and dist directories, as well as tweak what ports Webpack and WebpackDevServer run on.

Structure
---------

The folder structure provided is only meant to serve as a guide, it is by no means prescriptive. It is something that has worked very well for me and my team, but use only what makes sense to you.

```
.
├── bin                      # Build/Start scripts
├── build                    # All build-related configuration
│   ├── webpack              # Environment-specific configuration files for Webpack
├── config                   # Project configuration settings
└── src                      # Application source code
    ├── components           # Generic React Components (generally Dumb components)
    ├── containers           # Components that provide context (e.g. Redux Providers)
    ├── layouts              # Components that dictate major page structure
    ├── reducers             # Redux reducers
    ├── routes               # Application route definitions
    ├── stores               # Redux store configuration
    ├── utils                # Generic utilities
    ├── views                # Components that live at a route
    └── index.js             # Application bootstrap and rendering
```

### Components vs. Views vs. Layouts

**TL;DR:** They're all components.

This distinction may not be important for you, but as an explanation: A **Layout** is something that describes an entire page structure, such as a fixed navigation, viewport, sidebar, and footer. Most applications will probably only have one layout, but keeping these components separate makes their intent clear. **Views** are components that live at routes, and are generally rendered within a **Layout**. What this ends up meaning is that, with this structure, nearly everything inside of **Components** ends up being a dumb component.

Webpack
-------

### Configuration
The webpack compiler configuration is located in `~/build/webpack`. When the webpack dev server runs, only the client compiler will be used. When webpack itself is run to compile to disk, both the client and server configurations will be used. Settings that are bundle agnostic should be defined in `~/config/index.js` and imported where needed.

### Vendor Bundle
You can redefine which packages to treat as vendor dependencies by editing `vendor_dependencies` in `~/config/index.js`. These default to:

```js
[
  'history',
  'react',
  'react-redux',
  'react-router',
  'redux-router',
  'redux',
  'redux-devtools',
  'redux-devtools/lib/react'
]
```

### Aliases
As mentioned in features, the default Webpack configuration provides some globals and aliases to make your life easier. These can be used as such:

```js
import MyComponent from '../../components/my-component'; // without alias
import MyComponent from 'components/my-component'; // with alias

  // Available aliases:
  actions     => '~/src/actions'
  components  => '~/src/components'
  constants   => '~/src/constants'
  containers  => '~/src/containers'
  layouts     => '~/src/layouts'
  reducers    => '~/src/reducers'
  routes      => '~/src/routes'
  services    => '~/src/services'
  styles      => '~/src/styles'
  utils       => '~/src/utils'
  views       => '~/src/views'
```

### Globals

#### `__DEV__`
True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `development`

#### `__PROD__`
True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `production`

#### `__DEBUG__`
True when the compiler is run with `--debug` (any environment).

Styles
------

All `.scss` imports will be run through the sass-loader, extracted during production builds, and ignored during server builds. If you're requiring styles from a base styles directory (useful for generic, app-wide styles) in your JS, you can make use of the `styles` alias, e.g.:

```js
// ~/src/components/some/nested/component/index.jsx
import `styles/core.scss`;
```

Furthermore, this `styles` directory is aliased for sass imports, which further eliminates manual directory traversing. An example nested `.scss` file:

```scss
// current path: ~/src/styles/some/nested/style.scss
// what used to be this:
@import '../../base';

// can now be this:
@import 'base';
```

Testing
-------

To add a unit test, simply create `.spec.js` file anywhere in `~/src`. The entry point for Karma uses webpack's custom require to load all these files, and both Mocha and Chai will be available to you within your test without the need to import them.

Utilities
---------

This boilerplate comes with two simple utilities (thanks to [StevenLangbroek](https://github.com/StevenLangbroek)) to help speed up your Redux development process. In `~/client/utils` you'll find exports for `createConstants` and `createReducer`. The former is pretty much an even lazier `keyMirror`, so if you _really_ hate typing out those constants you may want to give it a shot. Check it out:

```js
import { createConstants } from 'utils';

export default createConstants(
  'TODO_CREATE',
  'TODO_DESTROY',
  'TODO_TOGGLE_COMPLETE'
);
```

The other utility, `create-reducer`, is designed to expedite creating reducers when they're defined via an object map rather than switch statements. As an example, what once looked like this:

```js
import { TODO_CREATE } from 'constants/todo';

const initialState = [];
const handlers = {
  [TODO_CREATE] : (state, payload) => { ... }
};

export default function todo (state = initialState, action) {
  const handler = handlers[action.type];

  return handler ? handler(state, action.payload) : state;
}
```

Can now look like this:

```js
import { TODO_CREATE } from 'constants/todo';
import { createReducer } from 'utils';

const initialState = [];

export default createReducer(initialState, {
  [TODO_CREATE] : (state, payload) => { ... }
});
```
